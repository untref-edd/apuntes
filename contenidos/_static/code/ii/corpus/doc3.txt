The Two Towers

After the Fellowship was broken, the quest continued on different paths. Frodo and Sam journeyed towards Mordor with the treacherous Gollum as their guide. Gollum promised to show them a secret way into Mordor, but his intentions were not entirely honest.

Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli pursued the orcs who had captured Merry and Pippin. The hobbits escaped into Fangorn Forest, where they met Treebeard and the Ents. The ancient tree-shepherds were moved to march on Isengard after learning of Saruman's treachery.

The battle of Helm's Deep tested the strength of men. King Th√©oden of Rohan and his people defended their fortress against overwhelming forces sent by Saruman. With the help of Gandalf and the arrival of reinforcements, the tide turned.
