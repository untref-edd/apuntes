The Hobbit, or There and Back Again

In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.

Bilbo Baggins was a hobbit who lived in his hobbit-hole at Bag End. He was very respectable and never had any adventures or did anything unexpected. That is, until Gandalf the wizard came to visit.

The wizard convinced Bilbo to join a company of dwarves on a quest to reclaim their treasure from the dragon Smaug. The journey took them through dangerous lands filled with goblins, wargs, and giant spiders.
