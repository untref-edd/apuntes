The Return of the King

The final confrontation approached. Frodo and Sam, aided by Gollum's knowledge of secret paths, came ever closer to Mount Doom. But the burden of the Ring grew heavier with each step, corrupting Frodo's mind and body.

Aragorn revealed himself as the true king of Gondor and rallied the forces of men for a final stand against Sauron. The Battle of the Pelennor Fields saw the Rohirrim charge to the aid of Minas Tirith, with Ã‰owyn slaying the Witch-king of Angmar.

At Mount Doom, Frodo's will finally failed and he claimed the Ring for himself. But Gollum attacked, biting off Frodo's finger with the Ring still on it. In his moment of triumph, Gollum fell into the fires of Mount Doom, destroying the Ring forever and bringing about the downfall of Sauron.
