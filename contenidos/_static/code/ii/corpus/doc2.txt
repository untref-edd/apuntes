The Fellowship of the Ring

The Ring passed to Isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever, but the hearts of men are easily corrupted. The Ring was lost for generations, until it came to Gollum in the depths of the Misty Mountains.

From there, the Ring passed to Bilbo Baggins, and then to his nephew Frodo. When Gandalf discovered that this was the One Ring, forged by the Dark Lord Sauron, he knew it must be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom.

Frodo set out from the Shire with his companions: Sam, Merry, and Pippin. They were joined by Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Boromir, forming the Fellowship of the Ring. Their quest was to take the Ring to Mordor and cast it into the fires where it was made.
